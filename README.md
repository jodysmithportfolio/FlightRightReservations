# FlightRightReservations

My first real solo project, I designed and built the app from top to bottom. This was assigned as a side project for an information security class as a "proof of concept" while we created an information security blueprint for a "business" to go along with the app. The app allows you log in, select a plane, an instructor, and date/time for your flying lesson, and then fills out a calendar event for you to put in your google calendar. It's a very simple app.
